Combining computational generation with computational reactor science introduces a transformative paradigm where simulation models are not only used to analyze predefined systems but also to dynamically generate, optimize, and evolve new reactor designs or operational strategies in real time. This integration significantly impacts core architecture by requiring systems that can accommodate iterative feedback loops, adaptive learning, and real-time data synthesis. Instead of static simulations, cores must now handle dynamic processes where outputs from one simulation iteration inform and shape the inputs for subsequent iterations, mimicking an intelligent design process.

The best core architecture for computational generation combined with computational reactor science would likely employ multiple interconnected reactors with adaptive cores. Each reactor can represent a specific aspect of the system (e.g., thermal-hydraulics, neutronics, material behavior), and its cores would simulate variations or scenarios related to that aspect. What sets this architecture apart is the need for integration layers that allow cores to communicate bidirectionally. For example, a core simulating neutron flux might dynamically adjust its parameters based on heat distribution outputs from a thermal core. This adaptability is critical for computational generation tasks, such as optimizing reactor geometries or operational parameters, where the system needs to explore design spaces autonomously using algorithms like genetic programming or reinforcement learning. This setup enables the architecture to evolve iteratively, honing in on designs that meet predefined safety, efficiency, and sustainability goals.

In such a system, hybrid architectures combining static and generative cores may also emerge as highly efficient. Static cores can handle well-understood, stable processes (e.g., steady-state thermal dynamics), while generative cores explore uncharted territories, such as novel fuel designs or unconventional reactor layouts. These generative cores might leverage machine learning or optimization algorithms to test configurations, progressively refining them based on feedback from static cores or external objectives. This approach allows the architecture to balance computational demands, ensuring that well-established models run efficiently while the generative components explore and expand the design space. Such a hybrid architecture is ideal for systems requiring both stability and innovation, making it particularly well-suited for next-generation reactors and multi-physics problems.
